## Welcome to the GitHub repository for the tcpl package.

<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=tcpl"><img src="vignettes/img/tcpl_hex.png" width="200" align="right" /></a>

The ToxCast Data Analysis Pipeline (tcpl) is an R package that manages,
curve-fits, plots, and stores ToxCast data to populate its linked MySQL
database, invitrodb. The package was developed for the chemical
screening data generated by the [US EPAâ€™s Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast)
program](https://www.epa.gov/comptox-tools/toxicity-forecasting-toxcast).
tcpl can be used to support diverse chemical screening efforts.
