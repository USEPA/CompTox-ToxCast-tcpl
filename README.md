## Welcome to the GitHub repository for the tcpl package.

The ToxCast Data Analysis Pipeline (tcpl) is an R package that manages,
curve-fits, plots, and stores ToxCast data to populate its linked MySQL
database, invitrodb. The package was developed for the chemical
screening data generated by the [US EPAâ€™s Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast)
program](https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecasting).
tcpl can be used to support diverse chemical screening efforts.
