\usage{
tcplLoadChem(field = NULL, val = NULL, exact = TRUE, include.spid = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{field}{Character of length 1, the field to query on}

\item{val}{Vector of values to subset on}

\item{exact}{Logical, should chemical names be considered exact?}

\item{include.spid}{Logical, should spid be included?}
}
\value{
A data.table with the chemical information for the given parameters
}
\description{
\code{tcplLoadChem} queries the tcpl database and returns the chemical 
information for the given field and values.
}
\details{
The 'field' parameter is named differently from the 'fld' parameter seen
in other functions because it only takes one input.

In the MySQL environment the user should be able to give partial
chemical name strings, to find chemicals with similar names. For example,
setting 'val' to "phenol" when 'field' is "chnm" and 'exact' is
\code{FALSE} might pull up the chemicals "Bisphenol A" and
"4-Butylphenol". More technically, setting 'exact' to \code{FALSE} passes
the string in 'val' to an RLIKE statement within the MySQL query.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
## Passing no parameters gives all of the registered chemicals with their
## sample IDs
tcplLoadChem()

## Or the user can exclude spid and get a unique list of chemicals
tcplLoadChem(include.spid = FALSE)

## In addition, the user can retrieve only the registered chemicals from the chemical table
tcplLoadChem(field = 'chem.only')

## Other examples:
tcplLoadChem(field = "chnm", val = "Bisphenol A")
tcplLoadChem(field = "chid", val = 20182)
}
