\item{ae}{Integer of length 1, the assay endpoint id}

A list of functions
}
\description{
\code{mc5_mthds} returns a list of additional activity cutoff methods to be used during level 5 
multiple-concentration processing.
}
\details{
The functions contained in the list returned by \code{mc5_mthds} take \code{aeids} 
(a numeric vector of aeid values) and returns a list of expressions to be executed in the 
\code{mc5} (not exported) function environment. The functions are described here for reference 
purposes, The \code{mc5_mthds} function is not exported, nor is it intended for use.

All available methods are described in the "Available Methods" section, listed
by the cutoff type in ascending order of cutoff value.

\section{Available Methods}{


The methods are broken down into five categories based on the type of cutoff they assign. 
Different methods are used to define cutoffs for "bmad" (baseline median absolute value), "fc" 
(fold change), "log" (\eqn{\log_{2}}{log2} or \eqn{\log_{10}}{log10}), "pc" (percent of 
control), and "other" (uncategorized cutoffs).

All methods are applied by aeid.

Although there are method exceptions (notably within the “other” category), only highest 
calculated cutoff value based on assigned methods will be selected for hitcalling. Therefore, 
only the largest cutoff method per method type should be assigned.

More information about the level 5 multiple-concentration processing is available in the package 
vignette, "Data_processing."

\subsection{BMAD Methods}{
 \describe{
  \item{bmad1}{Add a cutoff value of 1 multiplied by baseline median absolute value (bmad). By 
  default, bmad is calculated using test compound wells (wllt = t) for the endpoint.}
  \item{bmad2}{Add a cutoff value of 2 multiplied by the baseline median absolute deviation 
  (bmad). By default, bmad is calculated using test compound wells (wllt = t) for the endpoint.}
  \item{bmad3}{Add a cutoff value of 3 multiplied by the baseline median absolute deviation 
  (bmad) as defined at Level 4.}
  \item{bmad4}{Add a cutoff value of 4 multiplied the baseline median absolute deviation (bmad). 
  By default, bmad is calculated using test compound wells (wllt = t) for the endpoint.}
  \item{bmad5}{Add a cutoff value of 5 multiplied the baseline median absolute deviation (bmad). 
  By default, bmad is calculated using test compound wells (wllt = t) for the endpoint.}
  \item{bmad6}{Add a cutoff value of 6 multiplied by the baseline median absolute deviation 
  (bmad). By default, bmad is calculated using test compound wells (wllt = t) for the endpoint.}
  \item{bmad10}{Add a cutoff value of 10 multiplied by the baseline median absolute deviation 
  (bmad). By default, bmad is calculated using test compound wells (wllt = t) for the endpoint.}
