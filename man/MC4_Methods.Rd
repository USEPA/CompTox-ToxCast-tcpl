\title{List of level 4 multiple-concentration methods for calculating bmad}
\usage{
mc4_mthds()
}
\value{
A list of functions
}
\description{
\code{mc4_mthds} returns a list of methods to be used 
during level 4 multiple-concentration processing for calculating bmad
}
\details{
The functions contained in the list returned by \code{mc4_mthds} take 
\code{aeids} (a numeric vector of aeid values) and returns a list of expressions 
to be executed in the \code{mc4} (not exported) function environment. The 
functions are described here for reference purposes, The 
\code{mc4_mthds} function is not exported, nor is it intended for use.

All available methods are described in the Available Methods section, listed
by the type of function and the function/method name.

\note{
This function is not exported and is not intended to be used by the user.

\section{Available Methods}{



Although it does not say so specifically in each description, all methods 
are applied by aeid.

More information about the level 4 multiple-concentration processing is 
available in the package vignette, "Data_processing."

  \describe{
    \item{bmad.aeid.lowconc.twells}{Calculate the baseline median absolute value (bmad) as the 
    median absolute deviation of normalized response values (rep) for test compound wells 
    (wllt = t) with concentration index (cndx) equal to 1 or 2.}
    \item{bmad.aeid.lowconc.nwells}{Calculate the baseline median absolute value (bmad) as the 
    median absolute deviation of normalized response values (resp) for neutral control wells 
    (wllt = n).}
    \item{onesd.aeid.lowconc.twells}{Calculate one standard deviation of the normalized response 
    for test compound wells (wllt = t) with a concentration index (cndx) of 1 or 2; 
     \eqn{onesd=\sqrt{\sum{(resp-mean(resp))^{2}}/(n-1)}}{onesd = sqrt(sum((resp - mean 
     resp)^2)/sample size - 1)}. Used to establish BMR and therefore required for tcplfit2 
     processing.}
    \item{bidirectional.false}{Limits bidirectional fitting and processes data in positive 
    analysis direction only. Use for gain-of-signal or inverted data.}
