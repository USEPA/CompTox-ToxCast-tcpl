A list functions

\description{
\code{sc2_mthds} returns a list of functions to be used during level 2 
single-concentration processing.
}
\details{
The functions contained in the list returned by \code{sc2_mthds} return
a list of expressions to be executed in the \code{sc2} (not exported) 
function environment. The functions are described here for reference 
purposes, The \code{sc2_mthds} function is not exported, nor is it 
intended for use.

All available methods are described in the Available Methods section, listed
by the function/method name.

\section{Available Methods}{

The methods are broken down into four categories based on the type of cutoff they assign. 
Different methods are used to define cutoffs for "bmad" (baseline median absolute value), "pc" 
(percent of control), "pc or bmad", "log" (\eqn{\log_{2}}{log2} or \eqn{\log_{10}}{log10}), and 
"other" (uncategorized methods).

All methods are applied by aeid.

Although there are method exceptions (notably within the “other” category), only highest 
calculated cutoff value based on assigned methods will be selected for hitcalling. Therefore, 
only the largest cutoff method per method type should be assigned.

More information about the level 2 single-concentration processing is available in the package 
vignette, "Data_processing."

\subsection{BMAD Methods}{
 \describe{
  \item{bmad1}{Add a cutoff value of 1 multiplied by baseline median absolute deviation (bmad). 
  By default, bmad is calculated using test compound wells (wllt = t) for the endpoint.}
  \item{bmad1.5}{Add a cutoff value of 1.5 multiplied by the baseline median absolute deviation 
  (bmad). By default, bmad is calculated using test compound wells (wllt = t) for the endpoint.}
  \item{bmad2}{Add a cutoff value of 2 multiplied by the baseline median absolute deviation 
  (bmad). By default, bmad is calculated using test compound wells (wllt = t) for the endpoint.}
  \item{bmad3}{Add a cutoff value of 3 multiplied by the baseline median absolute deviation 
  (bmad). By default, bmad is calculated using test compound wells (wllt = t) for the endpoint.}
  \item{bmad5}{Add a cutoff value of 5 multiplied the baseline median absolute deviation (bmad). 
  By default, bmad is calculated using test compound wells (wllt = t) for the endpoint.}
  \item{bmad6}{Add a cutoff value of 6 multiplied by the baseline median absolute deviation 
  (bmad). By default, bmad is calculated using test compound wells (wllt = t) for the endpoint.}
  \item{bmad10}{Add a cutoff value of 10 multiplied by the baseline median absolute deviation 
  (bmad). By default, bmad is calculated using test compound wells (wllt = t) for the endpoint.}
 }
}

\subsection{Percent of Control Methods}{
 \describe{
  \item{pc0.88}{Add a cutoff value of 0.88. Typically for percent of control data.}
  \item{pc16}{Add a cutoff value of 16. Typically for percent of control data.}
  \item{pc20}{Add a cutoff value of 20. Typically for percent of control data.}
  \item{pc25}{Add a cutoff value of 25. Typically for percent of control data.}
  \item{pc30}{Add a cutoff value of 30. Typically for percent of control data.}
 }
}

\subsection{Percent of Control or BMAD Methods}{
 \describe{
  \item{pc30orbmad3}{Add a cutoff value of either 30 or 3 multiplied by the baseline median 
  absolute deviation (bmad), whichever is less. By default, bmad is calculated using test 
  compound wells (wllt = t) for the endpoint.}
 }
}

\subsection{Log Methods}{
Log Base 2
 \describe{
  \item{log2_0.76}{Add a cutoff value of 0.76 for log2-transformed data. This was a custom 
  threshold value set for endpoint id 1690 (formerly aeid 1691).}
  \item{log2_1.2}{Add a cutoff value of \eqn{log_{2}{1.2}}{log2(1.2)}. Typically for fold change 
  data.}
  \item{log2_1.5}{Add a cutoff value of \eqn{log_{2}{1.5}}{log2(1.5)}. Typically for fold change 
  data.}
 }
Log Base 10
 \describe{
  \item{log10_1.2}{Add a cutoff value of \eqn{log_{10}{1.2}}{log10(1.2)}. Typically for fold 
  change data.}
 }
}

\subsection{Other Methods}{
 \describe{
  \item{ow_bmad_nwells}{Overwrite the default baseline median absolute value (bmad) with a bmad 
  calculated using neutral control wells (wllt = n).}
  \item{ow_bidirectional_gain}{Where responses only in the positive direction are biologically 
  relevant, overwrite the max_med and max_tmp values, which were calculated using absolute 
  value, to a calculation using a true maximum for uni-directional data.}
  \item{ow_bidirectional_loss}{Where responses only in the negative direction are biologically 
  relevant, overwrite the max_med and max_tmp values, which were calculated using absolute 
  value, to a calculation using a true minimum for uni-directional data.}
