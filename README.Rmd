## Welcome to the GitHub repository for the tcpl package.

<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tcpl/index.html"><img src="vignettes/img/tcpl_hex.png" width="200" align="right" /></a>

The ToxCast Data Analysis Pipeline (tcpl) is an R package that manages, curve-fits, plots, and stores ToxCast data to populate its linked MySQL database, invitrodb. The package was developed for the chemical screening data generated by the [US EPA's Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) program](https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecasting). tcpl can be used to support diverse chemical screening efforts.

If you are interested in contributing or want to report a bug, please submit a issue or start a discussion. See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information. 

To install the current development version, run the following command:
